# Links Analysis:


## Email Sample 1:
<img width="1667" height="965" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d8e9265-4b4a-496f-b571-33110959b3a5" />
- URL: https://blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me/
  
- VirusTotal result: No security vendors flagged this URL as malicious.

- Reason still suspicious:

  - Domain name does not match official Bradesco domain.
  - URL structure looks auto-generated and shady.
  - Came from a spoofed banking email.
 


## Email Sample 2:
<img width="1661" height="965" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/595cfb8c-8eab-4a43-ac27-c85de3316932" />
- URL: https://i.imgur.com/Hr5TM3Y.png
  
 - A hosted image on Imgur (legitimate site).
 - Attackers often use trusted hosting (like Imgur, Dropbox, Google Drive) to hide phishing banners or redirect content.

- URL: http://go.nltrck.com/?c=495&source=consumentenbond&s1=&lp=1190
 - Domain: nltrck.com (not related to the sender’s supposed identity).
 - The go. subdomain indicates a tracking/redirector link.

 - The presence of query parameters like source=consumentenbond suggests it’s masquerading as something related to “consumer bond/organization” but is redirecting traffic elsewhere.

 - Uses plain HTTP (not HTTPS) → insecure, unusual for legitimate companies.
